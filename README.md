# InzoziBot-
InzoziBot (“Inzozi” means “dreams” in Kinyarwanda) is inspired by childhood traditions in Rwanda, where we shared and reminded each other of nightly dreams. This chatbot helps you log dreams, analyze recurring patterns using AI, and set reminders for dream-inspired goals—bringing a beloved cultural habit into the digital age.
