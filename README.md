# **InzoziBot**  

_"Inzozi" means "dreams" in Kinyarwanda._  

InzoziBot is a personal dream companion inspired by childhood traditions in Rwanda, where we reminded each other of the dreams we had at night. This chatbot brings that cultural habit into the digital world, helping users record dreams, uncover patterns, and turn dream-inspired ideas into actionable goals.  

**Note**: This project is currently under development on my local computer.
